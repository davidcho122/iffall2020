		<div class="paragraph">
			<p> Supreme co-wrote and stars in the 2009 film Vote Jesus: The Chronicles of Ken Stevenson, in which he poses as a right-wing political candidate to gain access into the world of American fundamentalism.</p>
			<em>
			<p>In 2012, Supreme starred in a web series entitled <strong>Learnin' with Vermin<strong> that uses a fictional version of his presidential campaign as a platform to teach political concepts such as voting methods.</p>
			<em>
				<p>A documentary following Supreme on the 2012 campaign trail and exploring his life and work as an activist and political prankster called Who Is Vermin Supreme? An Outsider Odyssey was funded through a Kickstarter campaign and premiered at the Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival on April 9, 2014.[68] The film was directed by Minneapolis-based filmmaker Steve Onderick and features founder of the Rent is Too Damn High Party, Jimmy McMillan, and Boston-based singer-songwriter, comedian, and fellow performance artist Rob Potylo.[14] The film was released to the general public on Vimeo on Demand on January 30, 2016</p>
