<h2>JOJI</h2>
<p>When it's lovely</p>
<p>I believe in anything</p>
<p>What does love mean</p>
<p>When the end is rolling in? <em>(Ooh)</em></p>
<p>Let it go, let it stay, can we love one another?</p>
<p>Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?</p>
<p>Who knows? <em>(Who knows?)</em></p> 
<p>I said who knows?</p>   
<br>
<p>Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go</p>
<p>I can't believe that I'm not enough</p>
<p>Not enough</p>
<p>And so long, no one will be here to save you</p>
<p>And no one will be here to let you know</p>
<p>Let you know</p>
<p>This is your world <em>(This is your world)</em> </p>
<p>This is your world <em>(This is your world)</em></p>
<br>
<p>Quietly still</p>
<p>In a lie</p>
<p>Oh, goodnight</p>
<p>I don't mind</p>
<br>
<p>Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go</p>
<p>I can't believe that I'm not enough</p>
<p>Not enough</p>
<p>And so long, no one will be here to save you</p>
<p>And no one will be here to let you know</p>
