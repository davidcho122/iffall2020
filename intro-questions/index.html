        <H1> Introductory Questions </H1>
        <p>1. My name is David Cho. I am a senior with a major in Biology and minor in Design</p>
        <p>2. I have always enjoyed the fine arts and aspects of design but never explored website design and coding. I wanted to learn the different ways and mediums to express design.  </p>
        <p>3. I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to create interactive web designs that engage the user.</p>
        <p>5. I think the difference between the two mediums will lie in the use of interactive components. On a screen, there will be movement and components that the user can engage with on a personal level. Meanwhile, design on paper is more confined and stationary.</p>
        <p>6. <a href= "https://sokoglam.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=SG+Brand+Rentention+-+V2+l_DE1+dac7&utm_term=kwd-887772195102&gclid=CjwKCAjwwab7BRBAEiwAapqpTKciqK3R1713R3TJDocR2Vx0H0hkbVQYLb-BN_aR4Op5N1s4tznM5RoCz5sQAvD_BwE"> Soko Glam </a> is a great example because it makes shopping very convenient and entertaining. The font and colors used are also in tune with the branding. </p>
        <p>7. <a href= "https://www.allkpop.com/"> Allkpop </a> delivers effective communication as it is ranks the popularity of each article with a interactive headline. The website for pop news is appealing because it is not too daunting like other news sites.</p>
        <p>8. I think <a href= "https://www.airbnb.com"> Airbnb </a> works well because it immediately directs the user with what they are looking for: available places to stay, ratings, prices, and locations in a fun user-friendly fashion. The colors are simple but effective--emphasizing the important parts with a single bright color. </p>
