                <h4>instructions.</h4>
                <li>cut the thick white part of the cabbage lengthwise in half.</li>
                <li>in a large bowl, dissolve 1/2 cup of salt in 5 cups of water. Thoroughly bathe each cabbage quarter in the salt water one at a time, shake off excess water back into the bowl, and then transfer to another bowl.</li>
                <li>generously sprinkle salt over the thick white part of each leaf. Repeat with the rest of the cabbage quarters. Pour the remaining salt water from the first bowl over the cabbage. Set aside for about 6 - 8 hours, rotating the bottom ones to the top every 2 - 3 hours.
                </li>
                <li>rinse thoroughly 3 times, especially between the white parts. drain well, cut side down.</li>
                <li>mix the rice powder with 1/2 cup water and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to a thin paste, and cool </li>
                <li>prepare the garlic, ginger and saeujeot. combine all the seasoning ingredients, including the rice paste and about 1/2 cup water (or the optional dashima broth), and mix well.</li>
                <li>cut the radish and optional pear into matchsticks (use a mandoline if desired), transferring to a large bowl. cut the scallions diagonally into about 1-inch long pieces. add the prepared seasoning mix to the radish, and mix well by hand. throw in the scallions, and mix everything lightly.Let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld nicely.</li>
                <li>spread the radish mix over each leaf, one to two tablespoons for large leaves</li>
                <li>place it, cut side up, in a jar or airtight container. Repeat with the remaining cabbages. Once all the cabbages are in the jar or airtight container, press down hard to remove air pockets. rinse the bowl that contained the radish mix with 1/2 cup of water (or any remaining optional dashima broth) and pour over the kimchi.</li>
                <li>leave it out at room temperature for a full day or two, depending on the weather and how fast you want your kimchi to ripen. then, store in the fridge.</li>
            </ol>
